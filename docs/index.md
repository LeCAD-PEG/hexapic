Our approach emphasizes optimal workload distribution, efficient computing accelerator usage, and enhanced communication and memory management to achieve a marked performance boost.

- **H2**: The necessity of developing fully-kinetic PIC codes is underscored as crucial for accurately modeling plasma technological processes. We aim to optimize our PIC code with state-of-the-art techniques, allowing for the integration of realistic geometries and comprehensive plasma dynamics. This initiative will greatly enhance our predictive and optimization capabilities, leading to unprecedented precision in plasma simulations.
