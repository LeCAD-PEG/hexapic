# XOOPIC

## Two-stream instability

* **Description**: Formation of two-stream instability when counter-propagating electron beams have velocities much larger than their thermal velocity, in a background of cold ions.

* **Input file:** original XOOPIC `two_stream_ee_es.inp` with modified grid size 256$\times$8 (from 256$\times$2)

## Electron Beam Spreading

* **Physics**: Spreading of an electron beam when propagating along metallic walls.

* **Input file:** original XOOPIC `xybeam.inp` with modified grid size 48$\times$24 (from 20$\times$20)
